Dear Reader

Thank you for having a look at my very simple WPF C# PDF Application. It is unfinished and uses many free libraries, but it was a fun porject and i actually used this program in my previous job to just do some simple PDF manipulation and it worked wuite well!

MORE PROJECTS TO BE ADDED to my portfolio soon!

Kind Regards,
Luke.
